# Welcome.

This is the second iteration of my portfolio that showcases some of the applications I have built.
It also includes some information on myself and an updated version of my cv.

## UX

### User Stories

As an employer I expect to see a showcase of Stephen's work.

As a recruiter I expect to see a showcase of Stephen's cv.

### Strategy

The goal in the design process was to make it as easy as possible to access relevant information on the application while striving for a minimalist and user-friendly design.

### Scope

For employers, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of myself and my capabilites. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of who I am, my background, work I have done, and my skill, with an option to contact me if they choose.

### Structure

In the 'work' section, I wanted viewers to be abble to quickly access work that I have done, providing a quick snippet summary of the project with a link to a Github repository and live link.
I have also included social links which is situated on a fade-in bar to keep a clean main navbar / footer.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using heroku.

## Thank you!

Thanks for viewing this portfolio.

this is a work in progress and probably always will be.. this is not suppose to be a ground breaking portfolio but more so to showcase what I have done previously and the technologies I have used.

Take care
Stevo!
